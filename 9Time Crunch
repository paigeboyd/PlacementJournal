<h2>December 2016</h2>

<p>On Tuesday morning Rachel approached me about making a poster for a competition that the University had held and was announcing the winners for that evening. I had two hours to get the poster finished and ready to send to the printers! This was the first time that I was under such a tight timeframe, normally I get tasks with at least 2 to 3 days to complete it, so I knew it would be a good learning experience to see how much I can get done when under pressure. </p>

<p>Rachel sent me a document with the text she needed on the poster which had been proof-read already so thankfully I didn't have to worry about that and could simply copy and paste. I set up the document and added 2mm bleed marks around the poster.</p>

<p>The poster was for Year 11 students from selected schools in the Greater Belfast area, and they had been asked to create a postcard illustrating how they see their city. I took inspiration from this and began creating an illustration of a few buildings you might see in a city. I knew it would be risky creating a complicated illustration under a tight time-frame but I wanted to give it a go as I thought it fit in well with the overall theme of the poster. I created a gradient background for the sky and added in a few clouds at the bottom, just above the illustration. As the poster was quite text heavy, I split the text into to columns to avoid having long lines in order to fit it all in. I placed the two University logos at the top, and titled it 'Your City'. The poster was approved straight away and sent to the printer to be printed in A2 size.</p>

<p>It was obviously a massive relief to get the poster finished on time and getting positive feedback was encouraging, especially knowing that I took a bit of a risk undertaking quite a detailed illustration. I could have spent all day playing around with the details and if I had more time I would have added more details on the buildings as this is a style I like to work in, but looking at the finished product I am content with how it turned out.</p>
