<h2>January 2017</h2>

<p>Julie contacted me looking a leaflet updated to reflect the new course names and information. The file was originally made by a previous placement student using Adobe InDesign. I had to get to grips with the software pretty quickly because I hadn't used it before, and up until now I had been able to create and update leaflets in Illustrator or Photoshop. I had a print version of the leaflet in front of me, so I was able to make the quick changes on this before moving into InDesign to ensure I hadn't missed anything. </p>

<p>I had to amend the course descriptions for Photography and Contemporary Applied Arts to Photography & Video and Ceramics, Jewellery & Silversmithing. I noticed the websites on the leaflet were directing to the old Belfast School of Art website so I changed these to point to ulster.ac.uk and the ADBE faculty pages. When I was using InDesign I noticed that a lot of the tables were made using shapes and lines, rather than an actual table and that the alignment of the information was off. I made these changes across the leaflet as when I was looking at the printed version, it looked somewhat messy and cluttered. </p>

<p>I checked over the leaflet for any missed spelling mistakes. Finally I saved a copy and added the 3mm bleed as well as a bleed and registration marks to the PDF file. </p>
