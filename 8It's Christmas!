<h2>December 2016</h2>

<p>With Christmas right around the corner and the end of the semester approaching, the Faculty likes to send out emails to students in their first year to congratulate them on completing their first semester and transitioning into university life. These emails also serve as a little reminder to those students that University doesn't stop at Christmas - there's still coursework submissions and exams for most. This year it was decided that a3 postcards would be emailed to the students with a summary of the information from the email on it. That's where I come in...</p>

<p>I started off by highlighting the important parts in the email that I wanted to include in the postcard, making sure to keep the information short and to the point. I then moved straight into sketching ideas. I had to make three postcards; one for each School, with a festive theme.</p>

<p>The first postcard I made was for the School of Art. I decided to create illustrations of christmas trees for this postcard. I styled them to look like they were drawn with a pencil, but kept it subtle. I played around with the positioning of the trees and decided on placing them to the right side of the card.</p>

<p>The second postcard was for the School of the Built Environment. I went for a slightly more sophisticated style of illustration but displaced the coloured fill from the outline, I thought it looked quite interesting. This postcard featured Christmas tree baubles. Instead of having the 'Seasons Greeting' as a heading, I incorporated it into one of the baubles.</p>

<p>The third postcard was for the School of Architecture and Design. </p>

<p>As these postcards were to be sent through email to all students in the three faculties, I made sure to optimise each image and reduce the file size as much possible to ensure that they didn't eat up the space within the students' inboxes.</p>
