<h2>October 2016</h2>

<p>The month kicked off with a few meetings about the website content for the Faculty. As the University goes through a complete rebranding, the old website is in the process of being migrated over to the new Content Management System; Squiz. With a new website comes new content and that was the topic of the majority of the meetings I attended. Lecturers and Associates needed to come up with short little 'bios' for themselves to be put onto a profile page, so visitors can see who's who? Alongside this everyone needed to be made familiar with the new CMS to understand how I will be displaying their content on the website.</p>

<p>Members of the Digital Content Team came down to the Belfast Campus to train me on using the CMS. Squiz is a bespoke CMS for the University and I was a little nervous about being thrown in at the deep end with something I'd never seen or heard of before. But when I was watching the demonstration it soon became clear that the CMS is pretty simple to navigate and will allow me to work with HTML and CSS when styling the content on the page. I was definitely glad about this because I want to keep up coding as much as possible during this year even though I'm in a designer role. </p>
