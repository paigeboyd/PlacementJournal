<h2>December 2016</h2>

<p>With the website live, the Digital team handed over management of the PhD Opportunities section to me. I was to treat this section as if it were a faculty on its own, meaning I would have to manage the content, ensuring that it is updated as and when needed. Although this will be a relatively simple task because the Built Environment and Art and Design Research Institutes both tend to take care of their own opportunities, it will give me good experience in managing and updating content on a live website. </p>

<p>The changes to the webpage needed to be discussed internally. I suggested that the webpage needed restyling, as at the moment it was very text-heavy. With some research into the other faculties, I put forward the idea of reducing the text down to a summary, and using an ordered list to display the links to the PhD topics once they were decided on.</p>
