<h2>November 2016</h2>

<p>With the website set to go live on Wednesday 23rd November, this week was spent taking care of the final little details to ensure a smooth migration. Some tasks I had were to ensure images were linked and appearing correctly, spelling and grammar was correct and that the sliders throughout the website were up to date with images. All were minor tasks but without this the website would look unfinished and wouldn't work as users would expect it to.</p>

<p>The day before the website went live I conducted some testing on the School of Art and School of Architecture and Design pages, involving making sure all of the links point to the correct pages - some were found to link back to the old website or to pages that weren't being migrated over as they were outdated. Testing was originally being taken care of by someone else, but it was passed over to me last minute, so there was some pressure to ensure that any bugs or mistakes were fixed quickly, but I found that fixing anything as I went along was the quickest way of getting the job done.</p>

<p>To finish, I signed off my sections of the website and they were set to go live with the rest of the website. The website went live and the transition was pretty smooth, however there were a few images which were showing up as broken links but the digital team took care of that within a few hours.</p>

<p>With the website live, it was made known that I was the point of contact for any content updates or changes within the School of Art, School of Architecture and Design, and the School of Built Environment, including the RIAD and BERI Research Institutes.</p>
