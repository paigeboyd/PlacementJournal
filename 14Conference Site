<h2>April 2017</h2>

<p>Gareth Alexander contacted me during the week regarding creating a website which would hold information for a conference he was holding. On Friday morning I met with him to get an idea of the purpose behind the website and what exactly he wanted. He talked me through what the ICAT Conference was about and showed me some examples of previous hosts' websites advertising the conference. He already had a pretty good idea of what he wanted the website to look like, and gave me some visuals to work off in terms of how these websites used 'quick links' menus and images. </p>

<p>Gareth was in the process of setting up a Word document with the structure of the website laid out for me, and the exact content he wanted in it. I grabbed some images from the brand image bank to give him an idea of what we had to work with, and we discussed the best ways to display the content within the constraints of the University brand guidelines. I suggested the use of tables, lists and images to break up the content, rather than just having pages with lines upon lines of information. I also put forward the idea of using PDFs within the site to allow the users to download and save or print out the information to take with them, as there would be visitors from abroad. </p>

<p>We explored the possibility of having a payment portal within the site, as the event required attendees to pay a registration fee. Unfortunately the University's payment system wasn't being used by the conference team, which meant that I wasn't able to work with it. After finding this out I did a little research and presented Gareth with a few ideas of third party options, with the main one being Get Invited as I had seen it being mentioned in lectures. </p>

<p>A week later Gareth sent through the completed website structure and content, and I got to work on setting up the webpages ready to input the content. As with a previous project, I used containers within the CMS to divide up the content into relevant sections on each webpage, as this is an ongoing project which I will be passing on to someone else once I finish my placement term. </p>
