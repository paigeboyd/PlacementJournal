<h2>September 2016</h2>

<p>I began my placement with the Faculty of Art, Design and the Built Environment (ADBE) in Ulster University on September 1st. My first few weeks were spent getting familiar with my base and getting to know the staff I would be working with, as well as setting up my workstation with the software I will be using during my placement, this included Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I also took this opportunity to look through the work which had been done last year to get a feel for what I could be doing. After I got settled in, Phil and I went for coffee during our lunch break to get to know each other a little more, as we would be spending the next 10 months working together. It was nice to get a glimpse into the social aspect of working in the University.</p>

<p>As my placement is within a University, there are brand guidelines and rules (a lot!) that I have to follow to keep within their brand. My first task was to get to grips with these, which took a while because there are so many guidelines that have to be followed so that my work can be approved by the Brand Team, for example the University only uses two fonts, allocated colours within each faculty as well as very specific placements of logos. The amount of guidelines there are was definitely intimidating at first, but mainly because this is the first time I worked within such a big corporation, so it took a bit of getting used to!</p>

<p>I was invited to a Brand Training session where the leads of the Brand Team took me and a few other students through the do's and don'ts of designing for the University. I got a good insight to how particular they are with tiny details in the work which will be released to the public, before this training session I wouldn't have considered how important tone of voice is when creating material - it's important to speak in a way that is easy to understand and is precise, but at the same time isn't patronising or belittling. Reflecting back on the session, however, I can definitely see why it is important to take these things into consideration, and that it's crucial to keep everything consistent to ensure the brand remains strong and at its best. </p>

<p>Now to remember it all!</p>
