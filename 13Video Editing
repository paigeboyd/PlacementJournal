<h2>March 2017</h>

- Editing video for UCAS Fair for ADBE Faculty promotional table.
- Setting up BSArt YouTube channel and prepping videos for upload.

<p>The next morning I had to quickly put together 17 certificates for the Dean's List recipients. I had to keep a corporate, formal design but make it unique to the Faculty. To do this I kept the layout of the certificate similar to previous years. I remembered how the Dean's List certificates I had recieved had used the faculty colours for the border. I had planned to do the same but had to stick to the corporate colour scheme because the new faculty name was being used and therefore the ADBE faculty pinks couldn't be used. I made use of the gold within the University logo for the border and to highlight certain parts of the text. </p>
<p>The final step was to insert Paul Seawright's digital signature into the document. When I did this and exported the file as a PDF, the signature became inverted. I wasn't sure why this was happening, so after a quick google search I realised to solve this I had to rasterise the image, as the software which was used to capture the signature wasn't compatible with Adobe Illustrator. The files were then sent to print on 120GSM A4 paper.</p>
