<h2>December 2016</h2>

<p>With Christmas right around the corner and the end of the semester approaching, the Faculty likes to send out emails to students in their first year to congratulate them on completing their first semester and transitioning into university life. These emails also serve as a little reminder to those students that University doesn't stop at Christmas - there's still coursework submissions and exams for most. This year it was decided that a3 postcards would be emailed to the students with a summary of the information from the email on it. That's where I come in...</p>

<p>I started off by highlighting the important parts in the email that I wanted to include in the postcard, making sure to keep the information short and to the point. I then moved straight into sketching ideas. I had to make three postcards; one for each School, with a festive theme.</p>

<p>The first postcard I made was for the School of Art. I decided to create illustrations of christmas trees for this postcard. I styled them to look like they were drawn with a pencil, but kept it subtle. I played around with the positioning of the trees and decided on placing them to the right side of the card.</p>

<p>The second postcard was for the School of the Built Environment. I went for a slightly more sophisticated style of illustration but displaced the coloured fill from the outline, I thought it looked quite interesting. This postcard featured Christmas tree baubles. Instead of having the 'Seasons Greeting' as a heading, I incorporated it into one of the baubles. This one was my favourite design in the end, I really liked the colour palette and how it all came together.</p>

<p>The third postcard was for the School of Architecture and Design. I kept this postcard simple and created a flat illustration of Christmas lights, using curves and a slight messy feeling to keep it interesting. I positioned this illustration to the top right of the card and displayed the information in the remaining space.</p>

<p>As these postcards were to be sent through email to all students in the three faculties, I made sure to optimise each image and reduce the file size as much possible to ensure that they didn't eat up the space within the students' inboxes - my experience as a student meant that this didn't cost me a second thought as I have missed out on emails because of my inbox being too full a few times! </p>


<p>About the final touches/decisions.. </p>

<p>On Tuesday morning Rachel approached me about making a poster for a competition that the University had held and was announcing the winners for that evening. I had two hours to get the poster finished and ready to send to the printers! She sent me a document with the text she needed on the poster which had been proof-read already so thankfully I didn't have to worry about that and could simply copy and paste. I set up the document and added 2mm bleed marks around the poster.</p>

<p>The poster was for Year 11 students from selected schools in the Greater Belfast area, and they had been asked to create a postcard illustrating how they see their city. I took inspiration from this and began creating an illustration of a few buildings you might see in a city. I knew it would be risky creating a complicated illustration under a tight time-frame but I wanted to give it a go as I thought it fit in well with the overall theme of the poster. I created a gradient background for the sky and added in a few clouds at the bottom, just above the illustration. As the poster was quite text heavy, I split the text into to columns to avoid having long lines in order to fit it all in. I placed the two University logos at the top, and titled it 'Your City'. The poster was approved straight away and sent to the printer to be printed in A2 size.</p>
